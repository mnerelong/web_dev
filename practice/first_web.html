        <h5>Disclaimer</h5>
    <p>This page assumes that you have prior knowledge of the very basics on Rain World (walking, jumping, throwing, the rain, etc).
        This guide will not relay anything taught in the vanilla game. <em>Spoilers will be labeled but not hidden</em>.</p>
    <p>If you want a guide that censors its spoilers and has more concise information, you can find the official wiki
        <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Rain_World_Wiki" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Movement</h2> 
            <h3>Backflips, slides, whiplash, and more.</h3>
            <h4>Backflip</h4>
            <p>The most important unexplained mechanic in Rain World is the backflip. Upon preforming a backflip, the player is put in a state where they
                are able to throw spears vertically (up or down). To carry out a successful backflip there is a mechanic in the games code that sets the time
                frame in which the backflip must be done. After the player simply walks forward for a <em>not so</em> extended period of time (aproximately three tiles but most
                likely less) if they turn abruptly they will recieve a smallish speed boost that lasts just a small duration. If the player jumps right after
                the boost they will have successfully done a backflip! These can be useful in many ways, including traversing difficult rooms, <em>accessing</em>
                difficult rooms, and can turn a fight the outcome of a fight in your favor.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>The speed boost mentioned beforehand can also be used for basic sprinting. By taking advantage of this and then hopping continuously afterwards you can maintain
                the extra speed for an increased amount of time.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4>Slide</h4>
            <p>Another of the most simple mechanics in the game is the slide. The basic slide allows the player to get across large spaces quickly (<strong>*if done right
            </strong>) and is also useful in the entering of tunnels or pipes. To slide, the player must crouch and jump nearly simultaneously and hold forward for
                the correct length (typically holding forward until the slide is over is acceptable, but fancier slides require different inputs). If the direction is not
            held long enough then you will have wasted your time.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Roll</h4>
            <p>One more important basic is rolling. When slugcat falls from up high it will usually be either incapacitated temporarily or dead. This can be avoided by holding down
                and a direction. There is a minimum of about four tiles (vertically) to do a roll, otherwise you will probably just end up laying on the ground. Max roll length
                is approximately three rolls or-- more accurately-- four thud sounds. After this, if the player does just jump, the roll will end. If they player does jump,
                they will leap (similar to a crouch leap) and when they land they will do another ~three rolls.
            </p>

            <p>Rolls can also be entered from
                backflips and slide variants and are <em>very</em> useful for exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>Ways slugcat can enter a roll:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Backflips</li>
                <li>Slide-pounces</li>
                <li>Slide-flips</li>
                <li>I'm sure there's more but I can't think of any :( </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Whiplash</h4>
            <p>Whiplash is not a single move*, but a state some techniques put the slugcat in. It is what allows the player to throw vertically
                (up or down) like seen in backflips. Whiplash can be entered in several different ways. Whiplash is only possible while the slugcat
                is in the air (or at least mostly in the air), otherwise it will be canceled. A list is provided below of ways to trigger whiplash.
