    <h1>Things in Rain World that scare me</h1>
<p><strong>The Gourmand</strong><br>You can barely move as this guy. There's some amazing gimmicks revolving around combat (and rolling is infinitely better too) but even jumping
too much causes the Gourmand to run out of breath and slow down A LOT. I mean... It was already super slow in the first place but now it's just GAME OVER. If you're running
from a lizard or something and jumping around out of fear then you are definitely not making it through the cycle.</p>

<br>
<p><strong>Daddy Long Legs</strong> (& friends)<br>They just block exits, that's it. I'm trying to get to Five Pebbles? It's in the tunnel I need to go through.
I need to go <em>up</em> through a chamber that switches between regular gravity and zero gravity while I can't see whats above me and I can't just
stop moving when theres zero gravity so I just keep going until I hit something? I hit a daddy long legs, pass through it's legs so that it detects me,
and it snatches me out of the air and eats me, no way to avoid it, even if I have a spear.</p>
